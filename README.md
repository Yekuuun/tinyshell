**TinyShell** is a base repo created due to my interest for OS-development under linux env. I recently switched onto a linux distro & after making some researchs on OS-dev projects ideas, minishell always came on top as a good beginner project for discovering linux internals and i never took the time to create one so let's go...

## Core features 

游릭 **Command lexing & parsing** : using lexer synhtax interpretation + quote handling + AST implementation for commands parsing.

游릭 **Signals interruptions handling** : handling interruptions

游릭 **Builtin functions** : base builtins functions `exit, echo, clear, history, pwd`

游릭 **Working on custom core functions** like `ls, cat, mkdir` etc for bringing more fun instead of calling execvp => creating my own programs.

游댮 **Command execution** : main core command execution

游댮 **Handling more options** : >>, <<, &&

游댮 **Handling env :** Handling environment variables
